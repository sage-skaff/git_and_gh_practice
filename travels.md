My Favorite Vacation Experience:
  I have been fortunate enough to have traveled to many different places. As a kid, every summer my family would vacation to a different place. My favorite of these was our trip to Costa Rica. We started off the vacation in the capital city of San Jose. We were there for a few days and explored a museum and a bird sanctuary near the hotel we stayed at. After that we went to a sea turtle conservancy, which was my favorite stop on the trip. In the day, we went on hikes through the forest, learning about the flora and fauna. At night, we went out on the beach and helped baby sea turtles that were stuck in the sand get to the ocean. After the sea turtle conservancy we stayed at a small accommodation that had zip-line facilities in the forest. We zip-lined and repelled up, down, and through the trees. Our next stop was large resort, where we enjoyed the pools, hot tubs, and hot springs. The last stop on the trip was a smaller resort with more personal accommodations. This vacation experience was memorable to me because it was a longer vacation than previous ones I had experienced, was just with my immediate family, and was the first time I had traveled outside of the country that wasn't on a cruise ship.
