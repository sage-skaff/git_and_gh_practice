My Hobbies:
- Holistic wellness activities including meditation, yoga, gardening, and cooking.
- Live Action Role-Playing (LARPing) with a community called Belegarth Medieval Combat Society (BMCS).
- Gaming, both in person and online. My favorite games are Magic the Gathering and World of Warcraft.
- Music, playing and listening. I play guitar/bass and enjoy listening to many different genres of music.
- Learning about how stories are told through various media. I would like to eventually write my own stories, but for now I just enjoy the learning and appreciation of stories.
